# Shopping cart

Shopping cart is a simple coding challenge, often described as a code kata. The objective of Shopping cart is to create a program with the following specification:

- Our goods are priced individually
- Some items are multipriced: 
    - buy n of them, and theyâ€™ll cost you y cents
    
- Our checkout accepts items in any order
- We need to be able to pass in a set of pricing rules each time we start handling a checkout transaction
- A total price should be output at the end of each checkout

 |Item|Unit Price|Special Price|
 |----|------|-------|
 |A|50|3 for 130|
 |B|30|2 for 45|
 |C|20||
 |D|15||
