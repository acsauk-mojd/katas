Ten green bottles
Hanging on the wall
Ten green bottles
Hanging on the wall
And if one green bottle
Should accidentally fall
There'll be nine green bottles
Hanging on the wall

Nine green bottles
Hanging on the wall
Nine green bottles
Hanging on the wall
And if one green bottle
Should accidentally fall
There'll be eight green bottles
Hanging on the wall

Eight green bottles
Hanging on the wall
Eight green bottles
Hanging on the wall
And if one green bottle
Should accidentally fall
There'll be seven green bottles
Hanging on the wall

Seven green bottles
Hanging on the wall
Seven green bottles
Hanging on the wall
And if one green bottle
Should accidentally fall
There'll be six green bottles
Hanging on the wall

Six green bottles
Hanging on the wall
Six green bottles
Hanging on the wall
And if one green bottle
Should accidentally fall
There'll be five green bottles
Hanging on the wall

Five green bottles
Hanging on the wall
Five green bottles
Hanging on the wall
And if one green bottle
Should accidentally fall
There'll be four green bottles
Hanging on the wall

Four green bottles
Hanging on the wall
Four green bottles
Hanging on the wall
And if one green bottle
Should accidentally fall
There'll be three green bottles
Hanging on the wall

Three green bottles
Hanging on the wall
Three green bottles
Hanging on the wall
And if one green bottle
Should accidentally fall
There'll be two green bottles
Hanging on the wall

Two green bottles
Hanging on the wall
Two green bottles
Hanging on the wall
And if one green bottle
Should accidentally fall
There'll be one green bottle
Hanging on the wall

One green bottle
Hanging on the wall
One green bottle
Hanging on the wall
If that one green bottle
Should accidentally fall
There'll be no green bottles
Hanging on the wall
