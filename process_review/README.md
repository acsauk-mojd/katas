# Process Review

(Heavily borrowed from Makers Academy)

_Get better at TDD_

A great way to get feedback on your TDD process is to participate in process reviews. In process reviews, you’ll pair up and spend 30 minutes observing your partner record their screen and TDD an exercise, while you use a rubric to note down what and how they do in order to give them useful feedback.

And then you switch - you’ll record your screen and TDD an exercise for 30 minutes while your partner observes to give feedback

## Why should I do this?
For a number of reasons.

Practicing writing code while under observation helps show you how good your current process is - where do you get stuck, how are you debugging, how's your approach to TDD - and therefore an accelerated way to improve.

Usefully you'll get feedback from your pair, and a recording to re-watch yourself write code.

It's great feedback and confidence-boosting to show yourself you're getting better at TDD.

## Exercises

To keep things simple and focussed on TDD rather than project/framework setup, you should aim to run your programs via a Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL) type program. For PHP there is a great option called [PsySH](https://psysh.org/) but any will do. See [here](../docs/psysh_repl.md) if you're struggling to load your code in a REPL.

Here are the possible programs to build. Complete them in the following order:

1. [Middle letter](./exercises/middle_letter)
1. [Leap Years](./exercises/leap_years)
1. [Ten minute walk](./exercises/10_minute_walk)
1. [Scrabble solver](./exercises/scrabble_solver)
1. [Checkout](./exercises/checkout)
1. [Change Converter](./exercises/change_converter)
1. [Echo](./exercises/echo)
1. [Bank](./exercises/bank)
